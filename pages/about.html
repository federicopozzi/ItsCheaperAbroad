                                    <p>The language we use belongs to the imagery of low cost, wanna-sell-you-everything
                                        marketing strategies and TV ads. Since the content comes exclusively from
                                        Instagram and we did not generate nor altered it, we are just putting together
                                        posts and comments.
                                        The exaggerated graphic and stylistic approach allows us to trace back and
                                        expose the real intention of marketing campaigns: sell you everything regardless
                                        of what it is.
                                        In order to achieve our aim, we studied what are the common elements found in
                                        big supermarket chains, home appliances superstores etc. flyers and promotional
                                        material. The most used graphic gimmicks are specific colors (red, yellow), bold
                                        fonts, big prices, the use of a lot of positive, stock images


                                        .


                                        Once we identified the language as the main problem, we exaggerating it in order
                                        to show that the medium is the real issue, while the content has the right to be
                                        promoted and shown. If we didn’t act on the medium it would have not been
                                        possible to stimulate a reflection on the content.

                                    <p>Instagram, thorughout time, increased its potential of selling you things through
                                        images.
                                        The consequence of this sell-you-everything approach brought Instagram to
                                        objectify users’ content in order to sell. Instragram has become a showcase of

                                        Medical tourism online is advertised with language of mass marketing or product
                                        of consumption. Selling medical procedures or computer hardware seems to be the
                                        same. The audience could be influenced by the mass marketing language and forget
                                        we are talking about medical procedures that bare risks and consequences. All
                                        the complexities and consequences are usually hidden because in advertising
                                        critical aspects or side effects are not shown. Some of the problems that are

                                        Medical treatments and procedures should be promoted carefully and counsciously
                                        because of complications they might involve. The sell-you-everyhting approach is
                                        not suitable for medical procedures because the person is not considered as a
                                        medical patient but it is only considered as a mere customer that could buy
                                        items in an online environment. Therefore, promoting medical procedures at the
                                        same level as all other marketable products comes with the great risk of
                                        banalizing human healthcare.

                                        This project starts from medical tourism but it is also about the way services
                                        are becoming merchandised through the advertisement language of social media
                                        platforms such as Instagram.

                                    <p>Among the categories analyzed on Instagram, the second most important is medical
                                        tourism.
                                        Medical tourism refers to people traveling abroad to obtain medical treatment,
                                        moreover it helps people getting medical treatment at a lower price compared to
                                        their country of origin.
                                    </p>

                                        Surgeries can be dived up into three categories based on the severity of medical
                                        procedures.
                                        This is very similar to the triage admittance process in the ER:<br/>
                                        • non-life-threatening surgeries (cosmetic);<br/>
                                        • non-life-threatening with major improvement on life quality;<br/>
                                        • life threatening surgeries.

                                        The majority of posts in the medical tourism are related to non-life-threatening
                                        surgeries or cosmetic surgeries. Therefore we analyzed how this kind of medical
                                        procedures related to medical tourism are marketed on Instagram,
                                        what kind of language it is used and what it is advertised when promoting these
                                        items.

                                        Instagram is the only data source of the project. Each content is clickable and
                                        it is linked directly to Instagram posts and comments to make the user exlpore
                                        real deals and offers.
                                        The user can explore the website starting from body items or countires. This are
                                        the two main pillars of medical tourism: healthcare and medical procedures
                                        (body) + touristic destination abroad (countries).

                                        We collected data from Instagram following a protocol: we looked for posts and
                                        stories that contained promos, deals and offers related to medical procedures.
                                        Then we created clusters based on body parts and countries in which
                                        the surgeries take place. Finally we narrowed down the selection process to 8
                                        body parts and 6 countries.
                                    </p>

                                        These treatments are only made possible by traveling. It is essential to make
                                        people realize where in the world they should travel in order to get the
                                        surgeries. This is why you will always find interactive maps at every step of
                                        the website that shows you where the clinics are located.

                      Instagram, thorughout time, increased its potential of selling you things through images. The consequence of this sell-you-everything approach brought Instagram as a platform to objectify users’ content in order to sell.
                      Instragram has become a showcase of each and every kind of product.

                      Medical tourism online is advertised with language of mass marketing or product of consumption. Selling medical procedures or computer hardware seems to be the same. </span>

                    <span>The audience could be influenced by the mass marketing language and forget we are talking about medical procedures that bare risks and consequences. All the complexities and consequences are usually hidden because in
                      advertising critical aspects or side effects are not shown.

                      This project starts from medical tourism but it is also about the way services are becoming merchandised through the advertisement language of social media platforms such as Instagram.</span>

                      The language we use belongs to the imagery of low cost, wanna-sell-you-everything marketing strategies and TV ads. Since the content we use comes exclusively from Instagram and we did not generate nor altered it, we are just
